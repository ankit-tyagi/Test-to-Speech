I would say “data are” because the word “data” is plural; however, I believe data is one of those words that could be used as a collective noun, such as “the group has arrived”. It reminds me of the newspaper editor who felt news was plural and should always take the plural verb. He would always ask the reporters, Are there any news?” One day a reporter answered him, “Not a new.”

So, I would determine whether or not to use the singular or plural depending on the context. If it is a discrete set of data, I would use the singular: if it is a varied heterogeneous collection of data, I would use the plural. Same as with jury: the jury has finally rendered a verdict, or, the jury are at each others’ throats.
